So far in our conversation, we've covered the initial setup and design preferences for your project, emphasizing the use of JSX, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, React hooks, and Lucide React icons.

We then addressed several errors:

Initially, there were "Module not found" errors related to UI components and Webpack caching issues.
Following that, a TypeError occurred, indicating problems with react-router-dom's LinkWithRef component.
In response to these, you provided clear instructions:

To fully remove react-router-dom and migrate to Next.js's built-in routing (next/navigation and next/link).
To replace all @supabase/... imports and the custom useAuth hook with Clerk's useUser() or auth() for authentication.
Most recently, an npm ERESOLVE error arose due to a peer dependency conflict between @clerk/nextjs and the installed Next.js version. I addressed this by updating the Next.js version in your package.json to 14.2.25 to satisfy the @clerk/nextjs requirement.
